Study of the Rockchip RK3328 bootrom

The file to look at is bootrom.txt

On December 20, 2022 I got an email from Marcin Wozniak telling me he had
extracted the bootrom image for the RK3328.  This is now included here,
along with the raw (and not yet annotated) disassembly.

I had this in my RK3399 repo (in the bootrom subdirectory) and some of
the tools used in the Makefile will be found there if they are missing here.
