Orange Pi R1+ LTS (Rockchip RK3328)

These are my bare metal programming projects and experiments for the RK3328
on the Orange Pi R1+ LTS board.  I am copying a lot from my RK3399 repo
(and making necessary changes) that has work I did back in 2021 (4 years ago)

A lot of notes are on my website:

Here are the projects you will find here:

* hello - a simple "do something" first project.
* bootrom - disassembly and analysis of the bootrom
* blink - second simple project - blink the status LED
* blink3 - blink all 3 onboard LED, big code cleanup
