The "booti" project for the Rockchip RK3328.

This was begun by copying the files from blink3,
since those have a decent printf() available.

I want to add a header to my startup file
that will allow me to try using the U-boot
"booti" command to start this code.

Then I want to see if this starts the code
running in EL1 as I hope it will.
